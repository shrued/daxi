Sleep and mental health are closely connected. Those with mental health problems are more likely to have insomnia or other sleep disorders. The burden of mental disorders continues to grow with significant impacts on health. Sleep deprivation affects your psychological state and mental health. Insufficient sleep is a pervasive and prominent problem in this day and age. That being said, sleep and meditation are closely connected too. Using meditation to mentally heal an individual has been proved to be a panacea in many cases. <br>
A significant percent of the world's population is struggling with mental and sleep issues every day. The web application that we propose will be an all-encompassing platform where people seeking help can find guidance, advice, and answers. We plan to provide a plethora of personalized content to help people get better in any way possible.

## Future applications
The data collected using the aforementioned features can be used to provide a plethora of personalized content. Based on the user's responses, the app should be able to provide regular insights and weekly assessments. The mood tracking board can be used to draw up a personal monthly report that can be given to the user's psychologist (if they have one). Of course, these reports can't replace a diagnosis from an actual doctor or psychotherapist, but they can help a patient discuss the situation with a therapist or a doctor. The app can also be equipped to send personalized reminders on top of subscriptions to an everday feed. An entirely new feature that can be implemented with more time is the Community feature which will bring together people from all over the world in a group chatting forum. In simple words, this app will be helpful to those curious about their feelings or those seeking help to understand and control their feelings.

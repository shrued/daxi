Sleep and mental health are closely connected. Those with mental health problems are more likely to have insomnia or other sleep disorders. The burden of mental disorders continues to grow with significant impacts on health. Sleep deprivation affects your psychological state and mental health. Insufficient sleep is a pervasive and prominent problem in this day and age. That being said, sleep and meditation are closely connected too. Using meditation to mentally heal an individual has been proved to be a panacea in many cases. <br>
